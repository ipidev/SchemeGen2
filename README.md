# SchemeGen2

SchemeGen2 is a random scheme generator for Worms Armageddon. It's being developed by ipi for anyone to use! 

##### What features will it offer?
I don't know! I've just started. Let's wait and see!

##### What happened to the first one?
The first SchemeGen was a horribly written Pascal program (which, at the time, was the only thing I knew how to use other than Game Maker...). It was never intended to be used by anyone other than me (the file output path was even hard-coded to my WA scheme directory!).

Despite its awful code, it did offer some fun and pretty silly schemes. It even went so far as to randomise RubberWorm settings!
